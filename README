Jabber::Simple - An extremely easy-to-use Jabber client library.

= Synopsis

  # Send a message to a friend, asking for authorization if necessary:
  im = Jabber::Simple.new("user@example.com", "password")
  im.deliver("friend@example.com", "Hey there friend!")

  # Send a message to few friends at once:
  im.deliver(["friend1@example.com", "friend2@example.com"], "Hey there friends!")

  # Get received messages and print them out to the console:
  im.received_messages { |msg| puts msg.body if msg.type == :chat }

  # Send an authorization request to a user:
  im.add("friend@example.com")

  # View contact list (returns array of roster items)
  im.contact_list

  # Get friend's vcard (pass nil for your own)
  info = im.get_info("friend@example.com")

  # Update your own info
  info = im.get_info
  info["NICKNAME"] = "amay"
  im.update_info(info)

  # Get presence updates from your friends, and print them out to the console:
  # (admittedly, this one needs some work)
  im.presence_updates do |update|
    from     = update[0].jid.strip.to_s
    status   = update[2].status
    presence = update[2].show
    puts "#{from} went #{presence}: #{status}"
  end

  # Remove a user from your contact list:
  im.remove("unfriendly@example.com")

  # Create a PubSub node
  im.create_node("/anode")

  # Publishing something to the node
  im.publish_simple_item("/anode", "body", "something")

  # Subscribing to a node
  im.pubsubscribe_to("/anothernode")

  # Getting the PubSub Subscriptions (returns an array of Jabber::PubSub::Subscription objects)
  im.pubsubscriptions

  # Get events from PubSub service (Jabber::PubSub::Event)
  im.received_events { |event|
    items = event.children[0]
    node = items.node
    item = items.children[0]
    id = item.id
    text = item.children[0].text
    puts "You got an update on #{node} with text = #{text} (#{id})"
  }

= Description

Jabber::Simple is intended to make Jabber client programming dead simple. XMPP,
the Jabber protocol, is extremely powerful but also carries a steep learning
curve. This library exposes only the most common tasks, and does so in a way
that is familiar to users of traditional instant messenger clients.

= Known Issues

* None. If you'd like additional functionality, please contact the developer!
